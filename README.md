# JSON Marshler tools for PHP

Simple set of tools for reading in an unverified JSON blob, such as from an
HTTP API, and spitting out PHP objects, whilst maintaining as much type safety
as possible.

These tools aren't designed for high speed work, but for batch processing
and extract/transform/load operations.
